### Logging Strategy

Define which use cases apply to this feature and what specific data to log:

**Applicable Use Cases**:
- [ ] Tracing - Execution flow and timing
- [ ] Error Tracking - Problem identification and diagnosis
- [ ] User Behavior - UX improvement insights
- [ ] Performance - Resource usage and efficiency
- [ ] Security Audit - Compliance and audit trails
- [ ] Business Metrics - KPIs and analytics

**Implementation Details**:
```
[For each selected use case, specify:]
- What specific events/data to log
- Required fields beyond standard (use_case, timestamp, trace_id)
- Retention period for this use case
- Any sampling strategy if high volume
```

**Privacy Considerations**:
[Identify any PII or sensitive data that needs sanitization]

## Security Considerations

[Authentication, authorization, data protection]

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests: [Coverage goals and approach]
- Integration tests: [Key scenarios]
- Performance tests: [Benchmarks and targets]

## Migration Plan

[If applicable, how to migrate from current state]
