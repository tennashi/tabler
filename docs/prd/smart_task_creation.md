# PRD: Smart Task Creation

## Problem Statement

Users need a quick and intuitive way to capture tasks as they think of them, without breaking their flow. Traditional
task input methods require too much structure upfront, making users choose between speed and organization.
Additionally, when thoughts are vague or complex, users need help clarifying and structuring their tasks effectively.

## Objectives

- **Primary objective**: Enable users to capture tasks as quickly as thoughts occur
- **Secondary objectives**:
  - Provide intelligent assistance for organizing tasks without being intrusive
  - Support both structured and unstructured input styles
  - Help users clarify vague thoughts into actionable tasks

## User Stories

### Story 1: Quick Task Capture

- **As a**: Busy user
- **I want**: To quickly input tasks without thinking about format
- **So that**: I don't lose thoughts or break my concentration
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Can create a task with a single line of text and Enter key
  - [ ] Input field is always easily accessible
  - [ ] Task is saved within 100ms of pressing Enter
  - [ ] No required fields beyond the task description

### Story 2: Natural Language Input with Shortcuts

- **As a**: User who wants some organization
- **I want**: To add metadata using natural language patterns
- **So that**: I can organize tasks without using complex forms
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Recognizes @ for dates (e.g., @tomorrow, @Friday, @12/25)
  - [ ] Recognizes # for categories/tags (e.g., #work, #personal)
  - [ ] Recognizes ! for priority levels (!, !!, !!!)
  - [ ] Shortcuts are processed and removed from task title
  - [ ] Works with both Japanese and English input

### Story 3: AI-Powered Understanding

- **As a**: User typing in natural language
- **I want**: The system to understand my intent without explicit shortcuts
- **So that**: I can write naturally without learning syntax
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Converts "by tomorrow" â†’ deadline of tomorrow
  - [ ] Recognizes project/category context from task content
  - [ ] Suggests appropriate priority based on keywords
  - [ ] Works seamlessly without user intervention

### Story 4: Task Clarification Through Dialogue

- **As a**: User with vague thoughts
- **I want**: AI to help me clarify my tasks through conversation
- **So that**: I can turn fuzzy ideas into clear action items
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] AI asks clarifying questions when input is vague
  - [ ] Questions are contextual and helpful
  - [ ] Can skip dialogue and save as-is
  - [ ] Dialogue helps identify subtasks when appropriate

### Story 5: Smart Task Decomposition

- **As a**: User with complex tasks
- **I want**: AI to suggest breaking down large tasks
- **So that**: I have manageable, actionable items
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Identifies tasks that are too large/complex
  - [ ] Suggests logical subtask breakdown
  - [ ] User can accept, modify, or reject suggestions
  - [ ] Maintains relationship between parent and subtasks

### Story 6: Mode Control

- **As a**: Power user
- **I want**: To control how the AI assists me
- **So that**: I can work the way I prefer in different situations
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Can force quick mode with /quick or /q
  - [ ] Can force dialogue mode with /talk or /t
  - [ ] Can force planning mode with /plan or /p
  - [ ] Default mode uses intelligent detection
  - [ ] Mode indicator shows current mode

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Must Have

- Single-line task input with Enter to save
- Inline shortcuts (@, #, !) for metadata
- Three input modes: Quick, Talk, Planning
- Automatic mode detection based on input
- Manual mode override commands
- Basic task CRUD operations

#### Should Have

- Natural language processing for dates and categories
- AI-powered task clarification dialogue
- Smart task decomposition suggestions
- Japanese and English language support
- Autocomplete for frequently used tags/categories
- Context learning from usage patterns

#### Nice to Have

- Voice input support
- Recurring task patterns
- Time estimation suggestions
- Integration with calendar
- Batch task creation
- Task templates

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Task creation completes in <200ms, AI suggestions in <2s
- **Usability**: New users can create first task without instruction
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, offline mode for basic creation
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## Success Metrics

- Average time to create a task: <5 seconds
- Task completion rate increases by 25%
- 80% of users use shortcuts within first week
- 60% of vague inputs successfully clarified through AI dialogue
- User satisfaction score >4.5/5

## Scope

### In Scope

- Task creation interface and interactions
- Inline shortcut parsing system
- AI integration for understanding and dialogue
- Mode switching system
- Basic task storage and retrieval

### Out of Scope

- Task editing and management UI (separate feature)
- Advanced project management features
- Team collaboration features
- Mobile app (initial release is web only)
- Integration with external task management tools

## Open Questions

- What LLM model/service should we use for AI features?
- How should we handle offline mode for AI features?
- What's the maximum task length we should support?
- Should shortcuts be customizable per user?
- How do we handle multi-language input in the same task?

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Task Creation

- Single-line task input with Enter to save
- Inline shortcuts (@, #, !) parsing
- Basic task CRUD operations
- Simple task list display

### Phase 2: AI Enhancement

- Natural language processing for dates and categories
- Smart task decomposition suggestions
- LLM integration for understanding intent
- Autocomplete for frequently used tags

### Phase 3: Interactive Features

- AI-powered task clarification dialogue
- Three input modes (Quick, Talk, Planning)
- Mode switching system
- Context learning from usage patterns

## Dependencies

- LLM API service (for natural language and dialogue features)
- Frontend framework decision
- Database/storage solution
- Authentication system (for multi-user support)
