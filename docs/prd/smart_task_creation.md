# PRD: Smart Task Creation

## Problem Statement

Users need a quick and intuitive way to capture tasks as they think of them, without breaking their flow. Traditional
task input methods require too much structure upfront, making users choose between speed and organization.
Additionally, when thoughts are vague or complex, users need help clarifying and structuring their tasks effectively.

## Objectives

- **Primary objective**: Enable users to capture tasks as quickly as thoughts occur
- **Secondary objectives**:
  - Provide intelligent assistance for organizing tasks without being intrusive
  - Support both structured and unstructured input styles
  - Help users clarify vague thoughts into actionable tasks

## User Stories

### Story 1: Quick Task Capture

- **As a**: Busy user
- **I want**: To quickly input tasks without thinking about format
- **So that**: I don't lose thoughts or break my concentration

#### Scenario: Basic task creation

- **Given**: User is on the task input interface
- **When**: User types "Buy milk" and confirms
- **Then**: Task "Buy milk" is created and saved immediately

#### Scenario: Empty input handling

- **Given**: User is on the task input interface
- **When**: User presses Enter without typing anything
- **Then**: No task is created and input field remains focused

#### Scenario: Continuous task creation

- **Given**: User has just created a task
- **When**: Task is successfully saved
- **Then**: Input field is cleared and ready for next task

### Story 2: Natural Language Input with Shortcuts

- **As a**: User who wants some organization
- **I want**: To add metadata using natural language patterns
- **So that**: I can organize tasks without using complex forms

#### Scenario: Date shortcut parsing

- **Given**: User is typing a task
- **When**: User enters "Meeting @tomorrow with team"
- **Then**: Task is created with title "Meeting with team" and due date set to tomorrow

#### Scenario: Category shortcut parsing

- **Given**: User is typing a task
- **When**: User enters "Review PR #work"
- **Then**: Task is created with title "Review PR" and category set to "work"

#### Scenario: Priority shortcut parsing

- **Given**: User is typing a task
- **When**: User enters "Fix critical bug !!!"
- **Then**: Task is created with title "Fix critical bug" and priority set to "high"

#### Scenario: Multiple shortcuts

- **Given**: User is typing a task
- **When**: User enters "Submit report @Friday #work !!"
- **Then**: Task is created with title "Submit report", due date Friday, category "work", and priority "medium"

#### Scenario: Japanese input support

- **Given**: User is typing in Japanese
- **When**: User enters "レポート作成 @明日 #仕事"
- **Then**: Task is created with title "レポート作成", due date tomorrow, and category "仕事"

### Story 3: AI-Powered Understanding

- **As a**: User typing in natural language
- **I want**: The system to understand my intent without explicit shortcuts
- **So that**: I can write naturally without learning syntax

#### Scenario: Natural date parsing

- **Given**: User has AI features enabled
- **When**: User enters "Finish presentation by tomorrow"
- **Then**: Task is created with title "Finish presentation" and due date set to tomorrow

#### Scenario: Context-based categorization

- **Given**: User has AI features enabled
- **When**: User enters "Call John about the marketing campaign"
- **Then**: Task is created with suggested category "marketing" based on content

#### Scenario: Priority inference

- **Given**: User has AI features enabled
- **When**: User enters "URGENT: Fix server outage"
- **Then**: Task is created with high priority inferred from "URGENT" keyword

#### Scenario: AI processing failure

- **Given**: AI service is unavailable
- **When**: User enters a task with natural language
- **Then**: Task is created as-is without AI enhancements

### Story 4: Task Clarification Through Dialogue

- **As a**: User with vague thoughts
- **I want**: AI to help me clarify my tasks through conversation
- **So that**: I can turn fuzzy ideas into clear action items

#### Scenario: Vague input triggers dialogue

- **Given**: User is in default or talk mode
- **When**: User enters "Need to do something about the project"
- **Then**: AI asks "Which project are you referring to?" and waits for response

#### Scenario: Contextual follow-up questions

- **Given**: User is in dialogue with AI about a task
- **When**: User responds "The website redesign"
- **Then**: AI asks "What specific aspect needs attention?" to further clarify

#### Scenario: Skip dialogue option

- **Given**: AI has asked a clarifying question
- **When**: User clicks "Save as-is" or presses Escape
- **Then**: Original task is saved without modifications

#### Scenario: Subtask identification

- **Given**: User enters "Organize birthday party"
- **When**: AI processes the input
- **Then**: AI suggests breaking it into subtasks like "Book venue", "Send invitations", "Order cake"

### Story 5: Smart Task Decomposition

- **As a**: User with complex tasks
- **I want**: AI to suggest breaking down large tasks
- **So that**: I have manageable, actionable items

#### Scenario: Complex task detection

- **Given**: User enters a complex task
- **When**: User types "Build new feature for user authentication"
- **Then**: AI detects complexity and offers to break it down

#### Scenario: Accept suggested breakdown

- **Given**: AI has suggested subtasks for a complex task
- **When**: User clicks "Accept breakdown"
- **Then**: Parent task and all suggested subtasks are created with proper relationships

#### Scenario: Modify suggested breakdown

- **Given**: AI has suggested subtasks for a complex task
- **When**: User edits the suggested subtasks before accepting
- **Then**: Modified subtasks are created with parent task relationship

#### Scenario: Reject breakdown suggestion

- **Given**: AI has suggested subtasks for a complex task
- **When**: User clicks "Keep as single task"
- **Then**: Original task is created without decomposition

### Story 6: Mode Control

- **As a**: Power user
- **I want**: To control how the AI assists me
- **So that**: I can work the way I prefer in different situations

#### Scenario: Quick mode activation

- **Given**: User wants minimal processing
- **When**: User indicates quick mode preference
- **Then**: Task is captured with minimal intervention

#### Scenario: Talk mode activation

- **Given**: User wants help clarifying their thoughts
- **When**: User indicates dialogue mode preference
- **Then**: System engages in clarification conversation

#### Scenario: Planning mode activation

- **Given**: User has a complex project to organize
- **When**: User indicates planning mode preference
- **Then**: System provides comprehensive task structuring assistance

#### Scenario: Default mode intelligence

- **Given**: No mode is explicitly specified
- **When**: User enters a task
- **Then**: System analyzes input and chooses appropriate mode automatically

#### Scenario: Mode indicator visibility

- **Given**: User has selected a specific mode
- **When**: Mode is active
- **Then**: Current mode is displayed near the input field
