# Workflows

This directory contains **processes and procedures** that guide AI agents through complex, multi-step operations.

## Purpose

Workflows define **how to execute tasks** - step-by-step procedures for accomplishing specific development goals.

## Files in this Directory

### Development Processes

- `tdd.md` - Test-Driven Development process adapted for AI agents
- `commit.md` - Step-by-step procedures for creating proper git commits
- `tool-installation.md` - Process for installing and configuring tools with mise

### Design & Architecture

- `collaborative-design.md` - Product design and PRD creation process
- `technical-design.md` - Engineering design and implementation planning
- `design-review-checklist.md` - Guidelines for evaluating abstraction levels in designs

## When to Use These Workflows

- **tdd.md** - When implementing new features using Test-Driven Development
- **commit.md** - When creating git commits (always follow this process)
- **tool-installation.md** - When adding new development tools to the project
- **collaborative-design.md** - When designing new product features
- **technical-design.md** - When planning technical implementations
- **design-review-checklist.md** - When reviewing or creating design documents

## Workflow Structure

Each workflow typically includes:

1. Prerequisites and context
2. Step-by-step instructions with clear decision points
3. Examples and templates
4. Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
5. Success criteria and validation steps
