# AI Agent Working Instructions

This is your primary instruction manual for working on this project.

## How You Should Work

### File Operation Protocol

When modifying ANY files in this project:

1. **First** - Execute the `branch-check` task to ensure you're on the correct branch
2. **Then** - Make your file changes (create, edit, or delete)
3. **Finally** - Execute the `commit-checkpoint` task to create proper commits

This sequence is mandatory for every file operation.

### Understanding the Structure

Each directory serves a specific role in guiding your work:

- **`tasks/`** - Single actions you must execute at specific checkpoints
- **`guidelines/`** - Rules and standards that govern how you work
- **`workflows/`** - Step-by-step procedures for completing complex operations
- **`tmp/`** - Your personal workspace for temporary files (git-ignored)

### When to Use What

- **Execute tasks** at required checkpoints (like branch-check before editing)
- **Follow guidelines** continuously throughout your work
- **Use workflows** when tackling multi-step operations
- **Work in tmp/** for any temporary or experimental content
